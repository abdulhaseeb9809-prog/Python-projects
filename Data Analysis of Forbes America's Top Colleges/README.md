# Forbes America's Top Colleges: ROI Analysis

## The Problem: Is College Actually Worth It?

Choosing a four-year college is one of the most stressful and expensive decisions a person can
make. With rising tuition costs and student debt, families are no longer just looking for a
"good school"—they are looking for a return on their investment.

The goal of this project is to cut through the marketing of 650 U.S. colleges to see which ones
actually deliver on their promises of career success, manageable debt, and high alumni 
earnings.

## What I Analyzed

I used Python to dig into Forbes' 2019 ranking data, focusing on:

- Financial Outcomes: Comparing what a college costs vs. what its graduates earn.
- School Type: Seeing if private schools really offer a better "salary boost" than public ones.
- Selectivity: How much a low acceptance rate actually correlates with future wealth.
- Location: Identifying the states that act as powerhouses for top-tier education.

## Key Findings & Visuals

### 1. The Payoff (ROI)

I found that while elite schools have high "sticker prices," their financial aid and alumni 
networks often lead to the highest long-term earnings.

###  2. Geographic Hubs

California and New York remain the dominant players, but certain smaller states offer 
surprisingly high-value "hidden gem" colleges.


## Conclusion & My Solution

After analyzing over 600 institutions, the "solution" to the college debt crisis isn't 
just picking the highest-ranked school.

### The data suggests a three-step strategy for students:

1. Prioritize Value over Rank: Many mid-tier public schools outperform Ivy League schools 
when you calculate the "Salary-to-Debt" ratio.

2. Look at the Grant Aid: The net price (what you actually pay) is more important than the 
annual cost. Elite schools often have better aid packages.

3. Location Matters: Choosing a school in a state with a strong job market (like CA or NY) 
significantly increases the probability of landing in the "High Salary" bucket ($130k+).

In short: College is worth it—but only if you choose based on data-driven outcomes rather 
than prestige alone.
